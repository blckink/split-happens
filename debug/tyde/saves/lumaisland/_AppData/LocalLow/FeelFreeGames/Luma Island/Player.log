Input mesh contained 2 degenerate triangles. These have been removed.
A degenerate triangle is a triangle with zero area. It resembles a line or a point.
Duplicate triangle edges were found in the input mesh. These have been removed. Are you sure your mesh is suitable for being used as a navmesh directly?
This could be caused by the mesh's normals not being consistent.
